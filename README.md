# Molecular Dynamics simulations of wild-type hERG, hERG-N629D, hERG-N627Y

* md.conf: Template configuration file for MD simulation with NAMD.

* [wt, n629d, f627y].prmtop: Topology files for the 3 model systems.

* [wt, n629d, f627y].inpcrd: Initial atom coordinates  for the 3 model systems.

* [wt, n629d, f627y].restart.[coor, xsc, vel]: Restart file for the 3 model systems. These files provide the state of the 3 systems after equilibration.

* [wt, n629d, f627y].replica[1-8].pdb: Atomic coordinates of the 8 replicas in the 3 model systems after 1 microsecond of MD simulations.
