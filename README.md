# Molecular Dynamics simulations of wild-type hERG, hERG-N629D, hERG-N627Y

* md.conf: template configuration file for MD simulation with NAMD.

* [wt, n629d, f627y].psf: topology files for the 3 model systems.

* [wt, n629d, f627y].pdb: PDB files for the 3 model systems.

* [wt, n629d, f627y].restart.[coor, xsc, vel]: Restart file for the 3 model systems. These files provides the state of the 3 systems after equilibration.
